# Data-Governance-Security-Automation-Azure-AD-Placeholder

Developed and implemented a comprehensive data governance and security automation framework to safeguard sensitive datasets, enforce regulatory compliance, and manage access controls across cloud platforms.

Detailed Description:

What you did: Designed Python scripts to authenticate and authorize users via Azure Active Directory, audit dataset access, and enforce automated compliance rules. Implemented monitoring and alerting systems to flag unauthorized access attempts and generate audit-ready reports.

How you did it: Leveraged Azure AD APIs to manage access tokens and permissions programmatically, created automated compliance checks, and integrated logging for all data access events. Developed modular scripts for reuse across different datasets and applications.

Use/Impact: This initiative enhanced data security, ensured adherence to industry regulations, and minimized risks associated with data breaches or misuse. It enabled proactive monitoring of sensitive data, provided clear audit trails, and strengthened overall data governance practices.
